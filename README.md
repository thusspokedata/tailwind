# Tailwind CSS

<hr/>
<ul>
<li>Tailwind CSS is a set of predefined CSS classes.</li>
<li>It is essentially writing CSS code directly in the HTML.</li>
<li>The main part of Tailwind CSS philosophy is HTML first, the idea is that you stay in the HTML as much as possible.</li>
<li>One of the main problems we avoid with Tailwind CSS is naming the classes.</li>
<li>Tailwinds uses a default layout which is 'Mobile First'.</li>
<li>The versatility of Tailwind CSS sometimes causes us to generate very long lines of code. We will also often find ourselves in situations where we are repeating our code. Fortunately, using React (or Vue) allows us to create components we can reuse.</li>
<li>We can also apply all Tailwinds classes within a self-created CSS file, where using @apply would allow us to use multiple Tailwinds classes in a single reusable class name.</li>
<li>We can also add new CSS rules using its configuration file called tailwind.config.cjs.</li>
<li>The biggest advantage that we will see in Tailwind CSS is its optimization when going to production. That is, at development time, Tailwind can weigh up to 3 MB because we can use all its features, but in production, not all the classes are necessary, so Tailwind will generate a CSS file leaving only the classes we are using, massively reducing the weight of our styles and allowing our site to load faster. This is possible because Tailwinds also uses PostCSS (which is a CSS preprocessor), which does this job.</li>
